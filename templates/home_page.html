        <h1>Greetings!</h1>
        <p>This is Group B's homepage for our Cancer Incidences dataset navigation software: the W. A. T. C. H. - Web Analysis Tool (of) Cancer History.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this home page is to guide you in the journey of further discovering the intricacies of out group's dataset. Specifically, this  is about the number of occurences of cancer within the U.S.</p>
        <p>The data is categorized by:
            <ul>
                <li>The [State] it happened in</li>
                <li>The [Year] it happened (we only have the cases from the year 2000 to 2021)</li>
                <li>The leading [Site] on the body where it happened</li>
                <li>The [Sex] of the person unfortunately inflicted with cancer</li>
                <li>Plus, a [Count] of occurences of each unique combination of the above factors.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Basic Filtering</h2>
        <p>Currently, our team has created some basic code to look up the counts of combinations, filtered based on the [Year] and [Site] provided. To ss them, please add ONLY ONE of the following to the URL of the homepage:
            <ul>
                <li>To filter by [Year], add the following into the URL: /year/[year_argument]</li>
                <li>To filter by [Site], add the following into the URL: /site/[site_argument]</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>For examples:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    /year/2007 = Get all cases occurring in the year 2007
                </li>
                <li>
                    /site/Liver = Get all Liver cancer cases
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>With each [*_argument] being replaced with a year/site that you are interested in</p>
        <h2>Advanced Filtering</h2>
        <p>We have recently updated with a more advanced modeling model, nicknamed the Great Filter, that you can use instead of the above Basic Filtering methods. Aside from the basic listing of all matching cancer cases, it will also provide you with the sum of the counts for all of those matched cases, plus the keywords that has been used to find those cases and the keywords that failed to find anything.</p>
        <p>To use the Great Filter, first choose the Combination Method:
            <ul>
                <li>If you want to require all of the inputs be present before a Case is included in the result, add /and/</li>
                <li>If you want to require only 1 of the inputs be present before a Case is included in the result, add /or/</li>
                <li>Please note that only these 2 combination methods are possible.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Then, add whatever data you want to be used to filter the dataset, in any order and separated by commas (the data can have whitespaces, but they will be split by commas). With how the Great Filter has been programmed, the order of your desired data doesn't matter, and invalid entries won't affect the result. For example:
            <ul>
                <li>[/and/Liver, 2007] Will return any cases that occurred in 2007 AND in the Liver</li>
                <li>[/or/Wyoming, 2013 , Breast] Will return any cases that occurred in 2013, in Wyoming, OR at the Breast</li>
                <li>Lastly, [/and/ Liver, the state of Death, 2010, Texas, 2003, Gallbladder] will translate to the combined list of any Case that match any of the possible /and/ combination, such as (Texas, 2010, Liver), (Texas, 2003, Liver), (Texas, 2010, Gallbladder), etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
                
        <h2>Data for filtering</h2>
        <p>You can use the following lists of data pieces to filter for information, following the instructions provided above: </p>
